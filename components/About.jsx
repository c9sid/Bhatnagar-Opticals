                        My name is Mohit Mohan Bhatnagar. I have completed my Bachelor's degree in Optometry and interned at Sadguru Seva Sangh Trust, Chitrakoot. I gained 2 years of experience at Gandhi Eye Hospital, Aligarh, and pursued a Fellowship in Optometry from Shroff Eye Hospital.
                        <br /><br />
                        I have worked with Project Prakash, led by Dr. Pawan Sinha, which aims to provide surgical interventions, education, and vocational training to children in India suffering from curable blindness.
                        <br /><br />
                        My expertise includes advanced vision therapy and special contact lenses for low vision. With 13 years of experience at Bhatnagar Opticals, Banda, I have now established a new unit, Uma Optical Hi-Tech Optometry Unit. I have also provided services to Rotary Eye Club, CAMS, and played a significant role in screening 40 blind schools at Shroff Eye Hospital.
